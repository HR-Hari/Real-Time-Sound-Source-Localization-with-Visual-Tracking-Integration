# Notes:,,,,,
# - Residual Noise Power = mean((Filtered_Noisy - Filtered_Clean)^2),,,,,
# - Filtered Signal Power = mean(Filtered_Clean^2),,,,,
# - Original Signal Power = mean(Clean^2),,,,,
# - Added Noise Power = theoretical noise added before filtering,,,,,
# - FIR filter: 950–1050 Hz, zero-phase,,,,
# - Plots show 3 cycles of 1kHz tone with auto-scaled axes for clarity,,,,,
